# Upstream massively reworked av1 support breaking our custom
# system-av1 patches.
# Looks like the bundled libvpx is heavily patched (including av1
#  support) - I'm not confident that currently enabling custom-patched
# system-libvpx gives the same experience as using the bundled one.
# Need to revisit in 125.0.
