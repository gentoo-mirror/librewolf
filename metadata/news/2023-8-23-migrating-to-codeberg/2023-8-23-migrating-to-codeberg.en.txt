As of now Librewolf has moved from Gitlab to Codeberg.

More information can be found here:
https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings/-/issues/265

Those who started using Librewolf's Gentoo overlay before the migration will
need to re-add the repository to recieve new updates.

For '/etc/portage/repos.conf'
=============================
Simply change the 'sync-uri' field to the url below.

https://codeberg.org/librewolf/gentoo.git

You may need to manually delete the repository and re-sync.

For 'eselect repository'
========================
1. Remove the overlay via

> eselect repository remove -f librewolf

2. then re-add the overlay via

> eselect repository add librewolf git https://codeberg.org/librewolf/gentoo.git

For those still using layman
============================
1. Remove the overlay

> layman -d librewolf

2. Re-add the overlay

> layman -o https://codeberg.org/librewolf/gentoo/raw/branch/master/repository.xml -f -a librewolf
